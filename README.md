# Intro-to-Database-Mangagement-System

Project Overview:

The Pokemon database

This database idea is inspired by the famous 90’s cartoon TV show called “Pokemon” which gets its name from “Pocket Monsters”. It also has a series of video games that was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo.

In this imaginative world, there are two main entities, Number one are the pokemons which are quirky monsters found throughout the world. They belong to a particular type (water, grass, fire, etc) and have their own unique skill set and statistics. The other entity are the trainers who travel to different places and try to capture these pokemon and put them in battle against other trainer’s pokemon. This helps them to gain monetary benefits as well as gym badges that help them to become the very best pokemon trainer in the world. The database would be a replica of an item shown in the TV show called “Pokédex” which stores all the information about the pokemon, their types, moves and locations at which they are seen. As the TV show has become severely popular and has many different seasons, many new pokemons have been created. But for this project, I will be focusing on the original 151 pokemons which are found in the Kanto region and the database would revolve around the Generation I games (Red/Blue/Yellow) based on these 151 pokemons. (Some table examples include Pokemon, Trainer, moves, types, pokemon_location, pokemon_evolution_chain, etc)
